Language Detector by Letter Frequencies

April 24, 2013

Language: Python

Language Detector by Letter Frequencies contains a csv file which includes the frequencies of 26 letters
in English, Dutch, German, French, Spanish, and Portuguese. We identify the language of a number of quotes, 
based only on that information by calculating and comparing their values of Maximum Likelihood Estimate.
